libpgjava Debian package
========================

This package has been extracted from the postgresql package because of
its dependency on a Java VM (unfortunately, there's currently no working
free JVM available).  The source tree reflects this, that is why the code
is three levels down.

The JDBC classes implement the JDBC 2.0 API for the Java2 platform. They
should work fine with JDK 1.1 and Kaffe, though.
