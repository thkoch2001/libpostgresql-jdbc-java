  * Built with sources...

libpgjava (7.4.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build with free vm's:
    - Updated README.Debian
    - Included README.jdbc2-interface explaining why these old java.sql.*
      source files are included, why they are needed and from where they come.
  * Move to main (closes: #300753)
  * Added patch to fix jikes compile error in JDBC2 optional classes
    (02_jikes_jdbc2-optional_compilefix.patch)
  * Build JDBC2 with optional classes but without SSL support
    Building with SSL support would prevent running the JDBC2 driver on 
    jdk1.3 runtimes without SSL extensions or using the -Xverify:none flag  
  * Build.xml (03_BuildXml.patch):
    - Patched to allow explicit selection of JDBC specification
      with -Djdbc2=true or -Djdbc3=true arguments during build
    - Patched to allow explicit selection of SSL usage during
      compile time with -Dssl=true (JDBC2 build has to be built without SSL)
    - Patched to allow explicit selection of compile target version with
      -Dtarget=1.3 for JDBC2 and -Dtarget=1.4 for JDBC3
